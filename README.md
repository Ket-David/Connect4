# Connect4-Game

#The objective for this game is that I want players to drop down the coin according to their color (Red and Yellow) so that they will get the 4 coins horizontally or vertically to win the game. More than this, I also want to make a strong bond between you and your siblings or your friends, meaning that you can play this game with anyone you want at any time that you are free. It is fun and you can also entertain and use your critical thinking at the same time because you have to think before choosing columns in the game to win over your opponent. Another objective of my game is that we want to implement UML and also the OOP concepts as well. 

#Future plan: to add the record option so that the users can still see the history that they used to play our game. And I also want to develop the complexity of the game as well so that when the users play the game, they will feel more challenged and more interested. Furthermore, I'm planning to add a timer when the users are playing, meaning that each player will get around 5- 8 seconds to think and choose which columns they should choose to drop the coins. I want to have a store feature where users can try to play our game and if they win, they can increase their scores and use those scores to change the theme of the coins that they play, by doing so it will make the game user interface more spectacular and not boring (not just the red and yellow coins), users can have a variety of themes.
